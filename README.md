# Prepare-Clean-Transform-and-Load-Data-using-Power-BI

Usually, tidy data is a mirage in a real-world setting. Additionally, before quality analysis can be done, data need to be in a proper format. In this project, I used Power BI for data cleaning and transformation. Specifically, I used different data cleaning and transformation tools like splitting, renaming, adding, removing columns. Also, in this pproject I changed data types, merged and appended data sets. By extension, data was imported from the web and unpivoted.
